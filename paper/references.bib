abstract = {Blindness affects millions of people around the world. A promising solution to restoring a form of vision for some individuals are cortical visual prostheses, which bypass part of the impaired visual pathway by converting camera input to electrical stimulation of the visual system. The artificially induced visual percept (a pattern of localized light flashes, or ‘phosphenes’) has limited resolution, and a great portion of the field’s research is devoted to optimizing the efficacy, efficiency, and practical usefulness of the encoding of visual information. A commonly exploited method is non-invasive functional evaluation in sighted subjects or with computational models by using simulated prosthetic vision (SPV) pipelines. An important challenge in this approach is to balance enhanced perceptual realism, biologically plausibility, and real-time performance in the simulation of cortical prosthetic vision. We present a biologically plausible, PyTorch-based phosphene simulator that can run in real-time and uses differentiable operations to allow for gradient-based computational optimization of phosphene encoding models. The simulator integrates a wide range of clinical results with neurophysiological evidence in humans and non-human primates. The pipeline includes a model of the retinotopic organization and cortical magnification of the visual cortex. Moreover, the quantitative effects of stimulation parameters and temporal dynamics on phosphene characteristics are incorporated. Our results demonstrate the simulator’s suitability for both computational applications such as end-to-end deep learning-based prosthetic vision optimization as well as behavioral experiments. The modular and open-source software provides a flexible simulation framework for computational, clinical, and behavioral neuroscientists working on visual neuroprosthetics.},

abstract = {We propose that a simple, closed-form mathematical expression—the Wedge–Dipole mapping—provides a concise approximation to the full-field, two-dimensional topographic structure of macaque V1, V2, and V3. A single map function, which we term a map complex, acts as a simultaneous descriptor of all three areas. Quantitative estimation of the Wedge–Dipole parameters is provided via 2DG data of central-field V1 topography and a publicly available data set of full-field macaque V1 and V2 topography. Good quantitative agreement is obtained between the data and the model presented here. The increasing importance of fMRI-based brain imaging motivates the development of more sophisticated two-dimensional models of cortical visuotopy, in contrast to the one-dimensional approximations that have been in common use. One reason is that topography has traditionally supplied an important aspect of “ground truth,” or validation, for brain imaging, suggesting that further development of high-resolution fMRI will be facilitated by this data analysis. In addition, several important insights into the nature of cortical topography follow from this work. The presence of anisotropy in cortical magnification factor is shown to follow mathematically from the shared boundary conditions at the V1–V2 and V2–V3 borders, and therefore may not causally follow from the existence of columnar systems in these areas, as is widely assumed. An application of the Wedge–Dipole model to localizing aspects of visual processing to specific cortical areas—extending previous work in correlating V1 cortical magnification factor to retinal anatomy or visual psychophysics data—is briefly discussed.}

	abstract = {Neural prosthetics may provide a promising solution to restore visual perception in some forms of blindness. The restored prosthetic percept is rudimentary compared to normal vision and can be optimized with a variety of image preprocessing techniques to maximize relevant information transfer. Extracting the most useful features from a visual scene is a non-trivial task and optimal preprocessing choices strongly depend on the context. Despite rapid advancements in deep learning, research currently faces a difficult challenge in finding a general and automated preprocessing strategy that can be tailored to specific tasks or user requirements. In this paper we present a novel deep learning approach that explicitly addresses this issue by optimizing the entire process of phosphene generation in an end-to-end fashion. The proposed model is based on a deep auto-encoder architecture and includes a highly adjustable simulation module of prosthetic vision. In computational validation experiments we show that such an approach is able to automatically find a task-specific stimulation protocol. The presented approach is highly modular and could be extended to dynamically optimize prosthetic vision for everyday tasks and requirements of the end-user.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

    abstract = {The feasibility of producing a visual prosthesis for the blind using intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) of the visual cortex was studied in a 42-year-old woman who had been totally blind for 22 years secondary to glaucoma. Thirty-eight microelectrodes were implanted in the right visual cortex, near the occipital pole, for a period of 4 months. Percepts reported as small spots of light, called phosphenes, were produced with 34 of the 38 implanted microelectrodes. Threshold currents for phosphene generation with trains of biphasic pulses were as low as 1.9 μA, and most of the microelectrodes had thresholds below 25 μA. Phosphene brightness could be modified with stimulus amplitude, frequency and pulse duration. Repeated stimulation over a period of minutes produced a gradual decrease in phosphene brightness. Phosphenes did not flicker. The apparent size of phosphenes ranged from a ‘pin-point’ to a ‘nickel’ (20 mm diameter coin) held at arm's length. Phosphene size usually decreased as stimulation current was increased but increased slightly as the train length (TL) was increased. At levels of stimulation near threshold, the phosphenes were often reported to have colours. As the stimulation level was increased, the phosphenes generally became white, greyish or yellowish. Individual phosphenes appeared at different distances from the subject. When two phosphenes were simultaneously generated, the apparent distances of the individual phosphenes sometimes changed to make them appear to be at about the same distance. When three or morephosphenes were simultaneously generated, they became coplanar. Except for rare occasions, phosphenes extinguished rapidly at the termination of the stimulation train. When stimulation TLs were increased beyond 1 s, phosphenes usually disappeared before the end of the train. The duration of phosphene perception could be increased by interrupting a long stimulation train with brief pauses in stimulation. Intracortical microelectrodes spaced 500 μm apart generated separate phosphenes, but microelectrodes spaced 250 μm typically did not. This two-point resolution was about five times closer than has typically been achieved with surface stimulation. With some individual microelectrodes, a second closely spaced phosphene was sometimes produced by increasing the stimulation current. Phosphenes moved with eye movements. When up to six phosphenes were simultaneously elicited, they all moved with the same relative orientation during eye movements. All phosphenes were located in the left hemi-field with the majority above the horizontal meridian. There was a clustering of most of the phosphenes within a relatively small area of visual space. The potentially greater microelectrode density and lower power requirements of ICMS compared with surface stimulation appears encouraging for a visual prosthesis. However, further studies with blind subjects are required to optimize stimulation parameters and test complex image recognition before the feasibility of a visual prosthesis based on ICMS can be established.},

Threshold current for the animal to detect this stimulation was highly consistent from day to day and, in the absence of tissue encapsulation of the electrodes or deliberately inflicted damage, remained stable indefinitely, 38 months in the longest case so far. Stimulating continuously for 1–8 h, however, produces an elevation of threshold, which may be permanent or temporary, depending upon a variety of conditions. A major cause of such injury is the hydrolysis commonly occurring consequent to passage of low-level currents between solutions and metal electrodes. Even when the hydrolytic reaction is eliminated by restricting the level of electrode polarization or by using capacitative stimulation with tantalum pentoxide electrodes, a rise in threshold often still occurs with protracted stimulation. With proper control in some instances, however, effective stimulation at 2–10 times the threshold level could be maintained indefinitely without apparent injury, e.g. in a blind monkey having a threshold of 290 µ A that could respond immediately to an 80 µ A diminution in 580- µ A,0.2-msec stimulus pulses which had been applied steadily for 1 h at 50 Hz.},

               vessels.6. Stimulation of a single electrode usually produces
               one phosphene, whose size ranges from tiny punctate sensations
               like ;a star in the sky' up to a large coin at arm's length.
               Very large elongated phosphenes, like those seen by Brindley's
               second patient, have not been reported despite the number of
               patients, electrodes, and combinations of stimulus parameters
               tested. These large phosphenes may be an effect of prolonged
               blindness.7. Stimulation substantially above threshold may
               produce a second conjugate phosphene, inverted about the
               horizontal meridian.8. Stimulation of a single electrode may
               also produce multiple phosphenes with no differential
               threshold.9. Chromatic effects and/or phosphene flicker may, or
               may not occur. This can vary from point to point on the same
               patient.10. Phosphenes fade after 10-15 sec of continuous
               stimulation.11. All phosphenes move proportionately with
               voluntary eye movements, within the accuracy of our mapping
               techniques.12. Brightness modulation can easily be achieved by
               changing pulse amplitude.13. The position of phosphenes in the
               visual field corresponds only roughly with expectations based on
               classical maps showing the projection of the visual field onto
               the cortex.14. Patients can usually discriminate phosphenes
               produced by 1 mm(2) electrodes on 3 mm centres, although this
               seems to be close to the limit of resolution.15. Patterns of up
               to four phosphenes produced by four electrodes have been
               recognized. However, a variety of complex interactions have been
               reported.16. Multiple phosphenes are co-planar, although
               patients are unable to estimate their distance.17. Phosphenes
               appear immediately when stimulation is begun, and disappear
               immediately upon cessation of stimulation.18. Future work must
               concentrate on blind volunteers to explore possible differences
               in subjective sensation produced after prolonged blindness, and
               to explore more complex pattern presentation which requires
               substantial periods of time with any given patient.",

abstract = {BACKGROUND A long-held goal of vision therapy is to transfer information directly to the visual cortex of blind individuals, thereby restoring a rudimentary form of sight. However, no clinically available cortical visual prosthesis yet exists.METHODS We implanted an intracortical microelectrode array consisting of 96 electrodes in the visual cortex of a 57-year-old person with complete blindness for a 6-month period. We measured thresholds and the characteristics of the visual percepts elicited by intracortical microstimulation.RESULTS Implantation and subsequent explantation of intracortical microelectrodes were carried out without complications. The mean stimulation threshold for single electrodes was 66.8 ± 36.5 μA. We consistently obtained high-quality recordings from visually deprived neurons and the stimulation parameters remained stable over time. Simultaneous stimulation via multiple electrodes was associated with a significant reduction in thresholds (P < 0.001, ANOVA) and evoked discriminable phosphene percepts, allowing the blind participant to identify some letters and recognize object boundaries.CONCLUSIONS Our results demonstrate the safety and efficacy of chronic intracortical microstimulation via a large number of electrodes in human visual cortex, showing its high potential for restoring functional vision in the blind.TRIAL REGISTRATION ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02983370.FUNDING The Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia Innovación y Universidades, the Generalitat Valenciana (Spain), the Europan Union’s Horizon 2020 programme, the Bidons Egara Research Chair of the University Miguel Hernández (Spain), and the John Moran Eye Center of the University of Utah.},

abstract = {We investigated the potential of the Utah Intracortical Electrode Array (UIEA) to provide signals for a brain-computer interface (BCI). The UIEA records from small populations of neurons which have an average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 6:1. We provide specific examples that show the activities of these populations of neurons contain sufficient information to perform control tasks. Results from a simple stimulus detection task using these signals as inputs confirm that the number of neurons present in a recording is significant in determining task performance. Increasing the number of units in a recording decreases the sensitivity of the response to the stimulus; decreasing the number of units in the recording, however, increases the variability of the response to the stimulus. We conclude that recordings from small populations of neurons, not single units, provide a reliable source of sufficiently stimulus selective signals which should be suitable for a BCI. In addition, the potential for simultaneous and proportional control of a large number of external devices may be realized through the ability of an array of microelectrodes such as the UIEA to record both spatial and temporal patterns of neuronal activation.}

abstract = {The development of a cortically based vision prosthesis has been hampered by a lack of basic experiments on phosphene psychophysics. This basic research has been hampered by the lack of a means to safely stimulate large numbers of cortical neurons. Recently, a number of laboratories have developed arrays of silicon microelectrodes that could enable such basic studies on phosphene psychophysics. This paper describes one such array, the Utah electrode array, and summarizes neurosurgical, physiological and histological experiments that suggest that such an array could be implanted safely in visual cortex. We also summarize a series of chronic behavioral experiments that show that modest levels of electrical currents passed into cortex via this array can evoke sensory percepts. Pending the successful outcome of biocompatibility studies using such arrays, high count arrays of penetrating microelectrodes similar to this design could provide a useful tool for studies of the psychophysics of phosphene perception in human volunteers. Such studies could provide a proof-of-concept for cortically based artificial vision.}
